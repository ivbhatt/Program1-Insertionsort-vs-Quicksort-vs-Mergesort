# Program1

This project was made in Spring 2021 as part of course-requirements for CSC505 : Design and Analysis of Algorithms offerred by Dr. Matt Stallmann.

We implemented three sorting algorithms: InsertionSort, QuickSort and MergeSort. We came up with certain hypotheses; designed experiments to verify them and then presented our results.
